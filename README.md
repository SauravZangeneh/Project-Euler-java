# Project-Euler-java

I've added my solutions for some of the Project-Euler problems :) 

They may not be the best or most efficient solutions out there but it's what I came up with in the timeframe. 

Hope it's helpful


If you're running the java code via terminal

Execute:  javac 'name of file without quotes'.java    (Compiles the file)
Followed by:  java 'name of file without quotes'   (runs it).
